# fract'ol

### Description:

This project involves creating graphically beautiful fractals using the school's graphical library, the MiniLibx.

### Requirements:
- Your program must offer the Julia set and the Mandelbrot set.
- The mouse wheel allows zooming in and out almost infinitely (within the computer’s
limits). This is the very principle of fractals.
- You must be able to create different Julia sets by passing different parameters to
the program.
- A parameter is passed on the command line to define what type of fractal will be
displayed in a window.
  - You can handle more parameters to use them as rendering options.
  - If no parameter is provided, or if the parameter is invalid, the program displays
a list of available parameters and exits properly.
- You must use at least a few colors to reveal the depth of each fractal. Experiment-
ing with psychedelic effects is encouraged.
- Your program has to display the image in a window.
- Window management must remain smooth (e.g., switching to another window,
minimizing, etc.).
- Pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program in a clean way.
- Clicking on the cross on the window’s frame must close the window and quit the
program in a clean way.
- The use of the images of the MiniLibX library is mandatory.

### Learning process:

Key things learned from this project:

- Graphical libraries and rendering.
- Fractals
- Complex numbers
- Coloring algorithms
- Organizing a somewhat complex project
- Creating (more) efficient Makefiles
